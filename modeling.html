							<p>It is now time to model our data to distinguish whether we will accept or reject our null hypothesis. In order to do that, we will employ segmented linear regression to compare the trends between the three time frames: Pre-Election, Election, and Post-Election Periods</p>

					<h2>Data Modeling</h2>
					<p class="text-justify">In order to answer the research question and approve or reject the null hypothesis, we employed time series analysis to understand the relationship between the period of time and the number of tweets before, during and after the recent election period.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="text-justify">The statistical model we used is <b>Segmented Linear Regression</b> to compare the trends in data among the time periods. Through this we determine the relationship between the frequency of tweets collected and the time interval. Data was split into three time periods related to the 2022 Philippine National Elections, namely:</p>
					<ol>
						<li class="text-justify"><b>pre-election period:</b> before February 8, 2022</li>
						<li class="text-justify"><b>campaign & election period:</b> February 8 to May 9, 2022</li>
						<li class="text-justify"><b>post election period:</b> May 10, 2022 onwards</li>

								<h3>Pre-Election Period</h3>
								<p class="text-justify">After performing the model in the pre-election subset of our data, the evaluation showed that the <b>root-mean-square deviation (RMSE)</b> is <b>1.84</b> with the <b>coefficient of determination (R2)</b> at <b>0.03</b>. This implies that the model has a reasonably good predictive accuracy but the low R2 value suggests that the model has a weak explanatory power.</p>
								<p class="text-justify">The <b>p-value</b> we got for the pre-election is <b>0.00477</b> which indicates a <b>significant relationship</b> between the date posted and number of tweets. However only a weak relationship is present between the two. There is also an <b>increasing trend</b> in tweet count as the pre-election period progresses.</p>

								<h3>Campaign and Election Period</h3>
								<p class="text-justify">After performing the model in the campaign and election subset of our data, the evaluation showed that the <b>RMSE</b> is <b>2.06</b> with the <b>R2</b> at <b>0.26</b>. This implies that the model also has a reasonably good predictive accuracy and the R2 value suggests that the model has a moderate level of explanatory power.</p>
								<p class="text-justify">The <b>p-value</b> we got for the pre-election is <b>0.06006</b> which indicates there is a <b>moderate relationship</b> between the date posted and number of tweets. However, the high p-value implies that the date posted has <b>no statistically significant impact</b> on the tweet count.</p>

This implies that the model has a reasonably good predictive accuracy but the R2 value suggests that the model has a moderate level of explanatory power.</p>
								<p class="text-justify">The <b>p-value</b> we got for the pre-election is <b>0.01245</b> which indicates a <b>significant relationship</b> between the date posted and number of tweets with a <b>moderate relationship</b> present between the two.

								<li class="text-justify">The highest peak for the whole dataset is in October 2020 within the pre-election period

										<li class="text-justify">This coincides with Liza Soberano’s speaking engagement in a Gabriela Youth webinar and Lt. Parlade warning the actress to cut ties with Gabriela Youth.</li>
									</ul>

								<li class="text-justify">There are multiple smaller peaks in March, April & May 2022 within the campaign & election period, with April having the highest peak in this time period
									<ul>
										<li class="text-justify">In March 2022, we determined that this was the month when 3 alleged former members of the NPA claimed that the Gabriela Women's Party is a recruiter for the group, and the time when Duterte identified Bayan Muna, Gabriela as fronts for CPP, NPA.</li>
										<li class="text-justify">In April 2022, we determined that this was the month when Gabriela condemned the online sexual harrasment aimed at Aika Robredo, daughter of the presidential candidate Leni Robredo</li>
										<li class="text-justify">In May 2022, this was the month of the 2022 Philippine Elections and the month when the Gabriela Women’s Party was proclaimed as one of the winning party lists by ComElec.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li class="text-justify">There are much smaller peaks present in July, September & October 2022 within the post-election period, with July having the highest peak in this time period
									<ul>
										<li class="text-justify">In July 2022, Gabriela challenged the Marcos Administration to do genuine service to the people, and President Bongbong Marcos Jr. held his first SONA.</li>
										<li class="text-justify">In September 2022, Gabriela denounced the ‘unjust arrests’ of women advocates by spearheading a protest in front of the Commission on Human Rights.</li>
										<li class="text-justify">In October 2022, NTF-ELCAC’s MR to investigate alleged Gabriela deposit accounts were denied by ComElec.</li>
